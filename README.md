Due to the update of CounterStrikeSharp, the namespace and implementation of the EventPlayerChat class have changed. As a result, the plugin has stopped working. I asked the author for the latest version but received no response. It seems that the plugin has been discontinued, so I'm uploading this temporarily available fixed version.
